# Interview Technical Assignment - Math Parser

As part of the interview process, we require all candidates to submit a solution to a technical test.  We expect you to complete this as you would production code and be mindful of the practices and behaviours that NICE will be looking for - testing, design, craftsmanship etc.  I would suggest that spending a few hours on the code is more than sufficient to give us an idea of your approach and technical ability. We are more interested in how you approach the problem than a complete solution, if you are really pushed for time.

===================

# Instructions
Implement a custom mathematical parser to take a string expression and compute its numerical value.

The parser must implement an order of precedence of left to right, brackets are used to explicitly denote precedence by grouping parts of an expression that should be evaluated first again left to right.

Rules:

a = '+', b = '-', c = '*', d = '/', e = '(', f = ')'
