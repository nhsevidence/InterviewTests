# Front End Technical Brief - Calculator

We ask all engineers to provide a solution to a short brief as part of our recruitment process at NICE. It's a great way for us to assess your technical abilities and help us understand the way you think about your development work.

We'll anonymously review your solution before inviting you for interview. Your test would then also form part of the interview itself: we'll discuss your approach, code and tests.

We look for a number of things when we're reviewing, including:

- Specific front-end coding skills
- Understanding of aspects such as accessibility, progressive enhancement, and performance
- Your choice of tooling and use of external libraries where appropriate
- How you structure an application.

## Your Submission

The details of the [the brief](#the-brief) are below but _please_:

- Provide your solution in **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**
  - Feel free to use a framework or view library (e.g. React, Angular, Vue)
- Don't spend more than 4 hours
- Write a couple of tests that will interrogate what you feel is the most important part of your solution
- Feel free to use NPM packages where appropriate.

_We're looking for a real-world solution to the brief, not an academic ideal._

You won't have time to complete everything, but **that's OK**!

We're more interested in your approach, thought process, application structure and where you stop, than a complete solution. For example what you prioritise or where you write tests and where you don't. We can discuss where you might go next with your solution in the interview.

**Please submit your solution by sending us a link to a git repo we can access publically. Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket are fine, as long as we can access your codebase.**

## The Brief

Create an interface to calculate equations with a single operator. Like a basic desk calculator it should:

- have buttons for numbers 0-9 and the 4 operators
- a textbox for seeing what numbers and operators have been input
- an equals button to calculate the current equation
- a list of previously run calculations and their results
- be fully usable with a keyboard and ideally usable with a sceenreader.

### Tips

- Don't focus too much on how it looks. We value usability and accessibility over design.
- Pull in any libraries or supporting packages to speed up your development.
- Just do what you can. We appreciate that people are busy and unpaid work like this can be an inconvenience. We're not looking for a calculator app to ship, we're just looking to get an insight to the way you think, how you approach creating a solution, and how you speak about and understand your work.
