# Interview Technical Assignment - Calculator Interface

We ask all engineers to complete a technical test as part of our recruitment process at NICE. It's a great way for us to assess your technical abilities.

We'll anonymously review your solution before inviting you for interview. Your test would then also form part of the interview itself: we'll discuss your approach, code and tests.

We look for a number of things when we're reviewing, including:
  - specific front-end coding skills
  - understanding of things like progressive enhancement, performance and accessibility
  - use of tooling and the npm ecosystem
  - how you structure an application.

## Your submission

The details of the [the test](#the-test) are below but *please*:

- provide your solution in **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**
  - use React if you prefer
- don't spend more than 3 or 4 hours
- write appropriate tests
- use npm packages where needed.

You won't have time to complete everything, but **that's OK**. We're more interested in your approach, thought process, application structure and where you stop, than a complete solution. For example what you prioritise or where you write tests and where you don't.

Submit your solutions via email as a zip file. Please remove any *node_modules* folders and add *.test* to the file extension so that it can get past email server filters (for example *calculator.zip.test*).

## The test

Implement a styled interface to calculate equations with a single operator. It should:

- have buttons for numbers 0-9 and the 4 operators
- a textbox for typing numbers and operators
- an equals button to calculate the current equation
- a list of previous run equations and their results.
