# Front End Technical Brief - Calculator

We ask all engineers to provide a solution to a short brief as part of our recruitment process at NICE. It's a great way for us to assess your technical abilities and help us understand the way you think about your development work.

We'll anonymously review your solution before inviting you for interview. Your test would then also form part of the interview itself: we'll discuss your approach, code and tests.

We look for a number of things when we're reviewing, including:

- Specific front-end coding skills
- Understanding of aspects such as accessibility, progressive enhancement, and performance
- Your choice of tooling and use of external libraries where appropriate
- How you structure an application.

## Your Submission

The details of the [the brief](#the-brief) are below but _please_:

- Provide your solution in **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**
  - Feel free to use a framework or view library (e.g. React, Angular, Vue)
- Don't spend more than 4 hours
- Write appropriate tests given the time you have
- Use NPM packages where appropriate.

_We're looking for a real-world solution to the brief, not an academic ideal._

You won't have time to complete everything, but **that's OK**!

We're more interested in your approach, thought process, application structure and where you stop, than a complete solution. For example what you prioritise or where you write tests and where you don't. We can discuss where you might go next with your solution in the interview setting.

Submit your solutions via email as a zip file. Please remove any _node_modules_ folders and add _.test_ to the file extension so that it can get past email server filters (for example _calculator.zip.test_).

## The Brief

Implement a styled interface to calculate equations with a single operator. It should:

- have buttons for numbers 0-9 and the 4 operators
- a textbox for typing numbers and operators
- an equals button to calculate the current equation
- a list of previously run calculations and their results.
